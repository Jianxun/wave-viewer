    title: Re-baseline deterministic replay and docs after protocol migration
    owner: Executor
    depends_on:
      - T-036
    dod:
      - Verify spec import/export and replay behavior remain deterministic under host-authoritative + revisioned protocol model.
      - Update architecture docs and testing strategy references to remove stale legacy workflow assumptions.
      - Add end-to-end regression coverage for explorer command flows (add-to-plot, add-to-new-axis, quick-add) across reopen/reconnect scenarios.
    verify:
      - npm run lint
      - npm test -- tests/extension/smoke.test.ts tests/unit/spec/roundtrip.test.ts tests/unit/spec/importErrors.test.ts
