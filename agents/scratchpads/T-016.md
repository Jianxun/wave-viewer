# T-016 Scratchpad

## Task summary (DoD + verify)
- DoD:
  - Add keybinding-backed actions for zoom-to-fit and cancel-active-gesture semantics in viewer scope.
  - Add context actions for side-panel signal items (`Add to Plot`, `Add to New Axis`, `Reveal in Plot`).
  - Update README usage workflow to document side-panel-first plotting interactions.
  - Add regression checks for command wiring and key action message flow.
- Verify:
  - `npm run lint`
  - `npm test`
