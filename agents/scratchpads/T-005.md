# T-005 Scratchpad

## Task summary (DoD + verify)
- DoD:
  - Map `PlotState` to Plotly traces/layout including `y1..yN` axis mapping.
  - Render right-pane canvas from active tab state and update on state changes.
  - Capture/restore zoom and range updates in state for deterministic replay fields.
  - Support visibility toggles and axis reassignment reflected live in chart.
- Verify:
  - `npm run lint`
  - `npm test`

## Read (paths)

- `doc/specs/wave-viewer-mvp.md`

## Plan
1. Add unit tests for Plotly adapter mapping (`y1..yN`, visibility, axis assignment, range restore).
2. Implement Plotly adapter + renderer and wire webview main loop to render active plot state.
3. Capture Plotly zoom/range relayout events and sync `xRange`/axis ranges back into workspace state.
4. Run verification, update task state/ scratchpad, push, and open PR.
