# T-041 - Plot Lifecycle Host Authority

## Goal
- Make plot tab lifecycle actions (`+Plot`, select plot, remove plot) persist through host-authoritative state.

## Scope
- Replace local-only webview mutations with intent -> host transaction -> host patch flow.
- Keep viewer state active-plot/active-axis selection coherent after plot changes.

## Verify
- `npm test -- tests/extension/smoke.test.ts`
- `npm run lint`
