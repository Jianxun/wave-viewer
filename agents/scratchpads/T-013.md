# T-013 Scratchpad

## Task summary (DoD + verify)
- DoD:
  - Contribute a VS Code side-panel signal browser view for loaded numeric signals.
  - Implement a `TreeDataProvider` for signal entries with add-to-plot command support.
  - Wire extension-host actions so side-panel interactions add traces to the active plot deterministically.
  - Keep current in-webview signal controls functional as fallback during migration.
- Verify:
  - `npm run lint`
  - `npm test -- tests/extension/smoke.test.ts`
  - `npm test -- tests/unit/webview/workspaceState.test.ts`

## Plan
- Add side-panel view contribution and tree provider plumbing in extension host.
- Introduce add-to-plot command path from tree items to active plot state updates.
- Keep legacy in-webview signal-add path untouched while validating both entry points.
- Run verify commands and capture evidence.
