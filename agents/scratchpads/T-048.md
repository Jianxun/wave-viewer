# T-048 Scratchpad

## Task summary (DoD + verify)
- DoD:
  - Add file watcher plumbing so manual edits to the bound layout file trigger host-side import/validation and `host/statePatch` broadcast.
  - Prevent update loops and race regressions using revision/hash guards and self-write suppression.
  - Define and enforce failure behavior for invalid external edits (error surfaced, previous valid state retained).
- Verify:
  - `npm test -- tests/extension/smoke.test.ts`
  - `npm run lint`

## Plan
1. Add failing smoke coverage for external layout edit reload, self-write suppression, and invalid-edit retention behavior.
2. Implement host watcher/reload controller and wire it into extension activation/session binding.
3. Re-run smoke and lint verifies, then close out task state and PR metadata.

## Milestone notes
- Intake complete; task moved to `in_progress`.
- Added smoke tests for:
  - external layout file edits importing into host state and broadcasting `host/statePatch`,
  - self-write suppression using autosave metadata + hash/stat matching,
  - invalid external layout edits preserving prior state and surfacing an error.
- Implemented `createLayoutExternalEditController` and wired it into extension activation with watcher setup for fallback and explicit layout bindings.
- Added manual-save metadata recording so watcher logic can suppress save-triggered self-reloads.

## Patch summary
- Added `createLayoutExternalEditController` in `src/extension.ts` with:
  - debounced file-change handling,
  - content-hash dedupe guard,
  - self-write suppression against autosave metadata,
  - import/validation + host state apply + `host/statePatch` broadcast.
- Wired watcher registration to viewer binding paths (open viewer fallback layout, bind-to-dataset, open layout, save layout as).
- Added `recordSelfWriteMetadata` support in autosave controller and used it for manual save/save-as writes.
- Extended viewer session registry with `getViewerBindingsForLayout` for targeted patch fan-out.
- Added `T-048` smoke tests in `tests/extension/smoke.test.ts`.
