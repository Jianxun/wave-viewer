# T-019 Scratchpad

## Task summary (DoD + verify)
- DoD:
  - Update README workflow section to document side-panel-first usage and transitional fallback expectations.
  - Document stabilization gate outcomes, known limits, and follow-up recommendations in task scratchpad.
  - Ensure task artifacts clearly state that in-webview signal-add deprecation remains deferred.
- Verify:
  - `npm run lint`
  - `npm test -- tests/extension/smoke.test.ts`

## Read (paths)
- `agents/roles/executor.md`
- `agents/context/lessons.md`
- `agents/context/contract.md`
- `agents/context/tasks.yaml`
- `agents/context/tasks_state.yaml`
- `agents/context/project_status.md`

## Plan
- Mark task in progress and validate task-state schema.
- Update `README.md` workflow guidance for side-panel-first + fallback/deprecation status.
- Validate with required lint/test commands.
- Finalize scratchpad with stabilization outcomes, limits, follow-up recommendations, and PR details.

## Milestone notes
- Intake complete.
- Stabilization handoff scope confirmed as documentation-only.
- README workflow updated to side-panel-first usage with explicit transitional fallback guidance.
- In-webview signal-add deprecation explicitly documented as deferred.
- Verification run completed with required lint + smoke checks passing.

## Patch summary
- Updated README usage flow to:
  - make side-panel signal actions primary (`Add to Plot`, `Add to New Axis`, `Reveal in Plot`);
  - preserve transitional fallback expectations for in-webview signal-add controls;
  - clearly state in-webview signal-add deprecation remains deferred.
- Added stabilization handoff notes in this scratchpad with outcomes, limits, and recommendations.

## PR URL
- Pending.

## Verification
- `./venv/bin/python scripts/lint_tasks_state.py`
  - OK: tasks.yaml and tasks_state.yaml are consistent.
- `npm run lint`
  - pass
- `npm test -- tests/extension/smoke.test.ts`
  - pass (19 tests)

## Status request (Done / Blocked / In Progress)
- In Progress (pending PR open + task state transition to `ready_for_review`).

## Blockers / Questions
- None currently.

## Next steps
- Run required lint and smoke checks.
- Open PR and transition task to `ready_for_review`.

## Stabilization gate outcomes
- Side-panel workflow is the documented primary user path for signal-add/reveal operations.
- Transitional in-webview controls remain supported to preserve migration parity.
- In-webview signal-add deprecation is deferred; this task does not remove or hide fallback controls.

## Known limits
- The fallback path remains available, so user behavior can still split between side-panel and in-webview controls.
- Large-dataset performance and lane-density readability limits remain open MVP constraints.

## Follow-up recommendations
- Define objective deprecation criteria (usage telemetry, parity confidence window, and UX sign-off) before removing in-webview signal-add.
- Continue parity regression checks on side-panel, drop-based flows, and fallback controls in each workflow-affecting change.
