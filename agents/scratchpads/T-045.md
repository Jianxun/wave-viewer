# T-045 Scratchpad

## Objective
Introduce explicit layout-session binding in host (layout URI as persistence identity) while keeping webview tuple-only.

## Notes
- Add/adjust viewer-session data model for `layoutUri`.
- Preserve `<csv>.wave-viewer.yaml` fallback when no explicit layout is selected.
- Keep YAML IO in host only.

## Verify
- npm test -- tests/extension/smoke.test.ts
- npm run lint
