# T-004 Scratchpad

## Task summary (DoD + verify)
- DoD:
  - Implement `WorkspaceState`, `PlotState`, `AxisState`, and `TraceState` models per contract.
  - Support create/remove/rename plot tabs and active tab switching.
  - Support trace instance creation from signals with axis assignment (`y1..yN`).
  - Implement axis manager state operations (add axis, remove axis with validation, axis reassignment).
- Verify:
  - `npm run lint`
  - `npm test`

## Read (paths)
- `agents/roles/executor.md`
- `agents/context/lessons.md`
- `agents/context/contract.md`
- `agents/context/tasks.yaml`
- `agents/context/tasks_state.yaml`
- `agents/context/project_status.md`
- `doc/specs/wave-viewer-mvp.md`

## Plan
1. Add failing unit tests for workspace state, tab operations, trace/axis operations, and validation rules.
2. Implement state models and reducer/state operations to satisfy tests and contract invariants.
3. Add minimal webview UI components (`Tabs`, `SignalList`, `TraceList`, `AxisManager`) wired to state actions.
4. Run verify commands, record results, and prepare PR closeout updates.
