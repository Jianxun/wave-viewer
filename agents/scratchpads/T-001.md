# T-001 Scratchpad

## Task summary (DoD + verify)
- DoD:
  - Document MVP goals, non-goals, and acceptance boundaries.
  - Define CSV data contract and initial UX flow decisions.
  - Capture open questions and options for T-002+ implementation tasks.
  - Keep discussion outcomes actionable for Executor handoff.
- Verify:
  - `./venv/bin/python scripts/lint_tasks_state.py`

## Read (paths)
- `agents/roles/architect.md`
- `agents/context/contract.md`
- `agents/context/tasks.yaml`
- `agents/context/tasks_state.yaml`
- `agents/context/project_status.md`
- `agents/context/codebase_map.md`

## Plan
1. Lock project boundaries for CSV-to-Plotly MVP in VS Code.
2. Convert ambiguities into explicit decision points with tradeoffs.
3. Produce follow-on task candidates with concrete file-level hints.

## Milestone notes
- 2026-02-11: Initialized context structure and started T-001.
- 2026-02-11: Established baseline contract (Plotly mandatory, local CSV-first).
- 2026-02-11: Locked MVP interaction model:
  - left pane signal browser + trace list + axis manager
  - right pane Plotly canvas
  - multi-plot tabs with per-tab X signal
  - trace instances allow same signal across multiple axes
- 2026-02-11: Locked axis provisioning strategy: extensible `y1..yN` ids in state/spec.

## Discussion prompts (scope definition)
1. CSV flexibility:
   - Option A: strict comma delimiter + `time` required.
   - Option B: auto-detect delimiter (`comma`, `tab`, `semicolon`) with fallback.
2. Time axis expectations:
   - Option A: numeric only.
   - Option B: numeric + ISO datetime parsing.
3. MVP interaction set:
   - Option A: zoom/pan/reset only.
   - Option B: add per-signal visibility toggles and autoscale shortcut.
4. Dataset limits:
   - Option A: enforce max rows with warning and refuse render.
   - Option B: downsample for preview and allow full-load opt in.

## Provisional outcomes
- CSV contract updated: no mandatory `time`; default X is `time` when present else first numeric column.
- Multi-plot model selected: tabs for MVP (tiles deferred).
- Signal-to-axis UX selected: add trace instance via axis menu from signal rows; axis editable in trace list.
- Performance strategy remains open and should be validated in a dedicated exploration task before hard commitment.

## Patch summary
- Created initial project context and task scaffolding.
- Added MVP contract and initialized T-001 planning artifacts.
- Added formal spec at `doc/specs/wave-viewer-mvp.md`.
- Sliced implementation tasks `T-002` through `T-007` with dependency chain and file hints.

## PR URL
- N/A (local initialization step)

## Verification
- Pending linter run after latest task slicing edits.

## Status request
- In Progress

## Blockers / Questions
- None for current scope-definition task.

## Next steps
- Start T-002 implementation from `ready` state.
- Keep delimiter auto-detect and decimation in exploration/backlog unless required by first benchmarks.
