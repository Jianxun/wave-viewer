# T-051 Scratchpad

## Task summary (DoD + verify)
- Update open/save/save-as/autosave/external-reload flows to consume/produce v2 schema only.
- Preserve host-internal canonical axis IDs (`y1..yN`) while mapping to/from user lane IDs in YAML.
- Keep runtime behavior stable: external layout edits must continue to hydrate tuples before state patch.
- Verify:
  - `npm test -- tests/extension/smoke.test.ts`
  - `npm run lint`

## Read (paths)
- `agents/context/lessons.md`

- `agents/context/tasks.yaml`
- `agents/context/tasks_state.yaml`
- `agents/context/project_status.md`
- `agents/roles/executor.md`

## Plan
- Inspect extension layout open/save/reload flows and current schema translation points.
- Add/adjust tests first for v2-only host workflow behavior (TDD).
- Implement minimal host-side changes to enforce v2 translation/defaults and tuple hydration stability.
- Run smoke + lint verification.
- Update task state and close out with PR.
