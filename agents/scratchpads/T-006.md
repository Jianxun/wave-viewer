# T-006 Scratchpad

## Task summary (DoD + verify)
- DoD:
  - Define `PlotSpec v1` YAML schema for workspace, plots, axes, traces, and ranges.
  - Implement export of deterministic rendered state fields to YAML.
  - Implement import path that reconstructs workspace and validates signal references.
  - Display explicit errors for missing signals/plots during spec import.
- Verify:
  - `npm run lint`
  - `npm test`

## Read (paths)
- `agents/roles/executor.md`
- `agents/context/lessons.md`
- `agents/context/contract.md`
- `agents/context/tasks.yaml`
- `agents/context/tasks_state.yaml`
- `agents/context/project_status.md`

## Plan
1. Add failing unit tests for YAML export/import roundtrip and import errors.
2. Implement `PlotSpec v1` model + export/import logic with deterministic ordering.
3. Wire extension commands for export/import and explicit user-facing errors.
4. Run verification, update scratchpad/state, push, and open PR.
