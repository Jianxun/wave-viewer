# T-064 Scratchpad

## Objective
Implement normalized HDF5 waveform ingestion using the run-centric contract in `doc/specs/hdf5-normalized-waveform-format.md`.

## Notes
- Keep `Dataset` consumer contract stable.
- Use deterministic dataset identity: `<file>#<run_id>`.
- Fail fast with actionable errors when required HDF5 nodes/attrs are missing.
