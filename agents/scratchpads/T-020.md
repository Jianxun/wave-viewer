# T-020 - Persist single-session loaded CSV registry for side-panel signal browser

## Task summary (DoD + verify)
- DoD:
  - Replace active-editor-derived signal listing with an explicit in-memory loaded-dataset registry for one Wave Viewer session.
  - Keep Explorer tree populated when focus moves from CSV editor to webview or other editors.
  - Render loaded files as parent nodes with signal children so signal actions can be scoped to a concrete loaded file.
  - Ensure existing side-panel signal actions continue to work against the selected dataset node context.
- Verify:
  - `npm run lint`
  - `npm test -- tests/extension/smoke.test.ts tests/unit/webview/workspaceState.test.ts`

## Plan
- Move side-panel data source from active-editor CSV parsing to a session-level loaded dataset registry.
- Update signal tree model to show file nodes with child signal nodes.
- Keep existing signal actions working by carrying dataset context through tree items and command routing.
- Add/adjust smoke tests for persisted registry behavior and dataset-scoped actions.
