# T-017 Scratchpad

## Task summary (DoD + verify)
- DoD:
  - Add regression coverage proving equivalent workspace outcomes for side-panel command, axis-row drop, and canvas-overlay drop paths.
  - Verify fallback in-webview signal controls remain functional during stabilization window.
  - Record stabilization test evidence and residual risks in task scratchpad.
- Verify:
  - `npm run lint`
  - `npm test -- tests/extension/smoke.test.ts tests/unit/webview/workspaceState.test.ts tests/unit/webview/plotly/adapter.test.ts`
