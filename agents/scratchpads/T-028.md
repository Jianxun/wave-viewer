# T-028 — Refactor viewer signal panel to show available and per-lane assigned signals

## Task summary (DoD + verify)
- Replace single flat signal list UX with sections that make lane assignment explicit (available signals + per-lane assignments).
- Ensure UI remains deterministic and consistent with reducer state after add/remove/reassign/reorder operations.
- Preserve existing drag/drop and quick-add functionality while updating signal display structure.
- Add unit/smoke checks for new signal panel rendering and interactions.

Verify:
- `npm run lint`
- `npm test -- tests/unit/webview/workspaceState.test.ts tests/extension/smoke.test.ts`

## Plan
- Inspect current signal panel rendering and webview interactions.
- Add tests first for sectioned signal panel behavior.
- Implement sectioned panel UI while preserving existing add/remove/drag flows.
- Run required verification and record results.
